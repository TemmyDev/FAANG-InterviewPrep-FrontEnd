## Time Complexity

* If each node in the tree is visited only once, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We cannot do better than that, since at the very least we have to visit each node to invert it. Because of recursion, `O(h)` function calls will be placed on the stack in the worst case, where hhh is the height of the tree. Because `hâˆˆO(n)`, the space complexity is `O(n)`. e.g., inverting a binary tree

## Space Complexity
* If you need to keep a counter of characters, a common mistake is to say that the space complexity required for the counter is `O(n)`. The space required for a counter is `O(1)` not `O(n)`. This is because the upper bound is the range of characters, which is usually a fixed constant of 26. The input set is just lowercase Latin characters. e.g., Frequency counting of characters will help to determine if two strings are anagrams. This also takes `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.
