## Time Complexity

## Space Complexity
* If you need to keep a counter of characters, a common mistake is to say that the space complexity required for the counter is O(n). The space required for a counter is O(1) not O(n). This is because the upper bound is the range of characters, which is usually a fixed constant of 26. The input set is just lowercase Latin characters. e.g., Frequency counting of characters will help to determine if two strings are anagrams. This also takes O(n) time and O(1) space.
